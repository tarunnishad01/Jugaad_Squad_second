To understand and analyze the performance of advanced digital modulation schemes such as QPSK and M-ary PSK through simulation and experimentation, and to evaluate their Bit Error Rate (BER) performance under varying channel conditions such as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels. The experiment aims to:

1.Demonstrate the signal constellation and waveform characteristics of QPSK and M-ary PSK schemes.

2.Compare the spectral efficiency and power efficiency of various modulation orders (e.g., 4-PSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK, etc.).

3.Analyze the BER performance of these modulation techniques for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.

4.Interpret the trade-offs between bandwidth, power, and error performance in advanced digital modulation.

5.Develop practical insights into how digital modulation schemes are used in modern communication systems such as wireless networks, satellite communication, and software-defined radios (SDRs).
